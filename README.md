### To Build

`$ make`

### Controls

1. Note that the program will _not_ automatically tell you if you are out of moves. If you are out of moves, press the `S` key to skip your turn and let the next available player play.

2. If you have played all of your pieces, the program will automatically switch to the next player who has not played all of their pieces.

3. If you have determined that there are no more pieces to play, press `E` to end the game, calculating the scores and determining the winner.

_SPACE_ := place piece on board <br>
_C KEY_ := rotate piece <br>
_A KEY_ := reflect piece <br>
_S KEY_ := skip turn <br>
_P KEY_ := print piece to terminal (debugging) <br>
_Z KEY_ := swap piece (backwards) <br>
_X KEY_ := swap piece (forwards) <br>
_E KEY_ := end game (calculate scores, etc) <br>
